    <h1>HabitFlow Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: September 09, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>At Senflow AI LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how HabitFlow handles information when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>No Collection of Personal Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HabitFlow is designed to run locally on your device. Your habit entries and related data are stored only on your device.</li>
        <li>We do not collect, store, sell, or share your personal data on company servers. We do not use your data for tracking or targeted advertising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Optional Diagnostic Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We may process limited non-personal information (e.g., device model, iOS version, crash logs) solely to troubleshoot issues and improve performance. This information is not used to identify you and may be disabled via your system settings (e.g., crash reporting).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain core app functionality on device.</li>
        <li>Improve usability, reliability, and features.</li>
        <li>Analyze crashes and performance issues where diagnostic logs are available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not sell or trade personal information. If we work with service providers (e.g., for support websites or email), they are required to protect confidentiality and process data only on our instructions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to help secure data stored on your device. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
        <li>If you choose to export or back up your data using third-party services (e.g., iCloud, email, or file sharing), their privacy terms will apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The app is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware of such collection, we will delete the information promptly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA and Similar Laws)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or obtain a copy of information you have shared with us, and to restrict or object to certain processing, as well as data portability where applicable.</li>
        <li>To exercise these rights or ask questions, contact: contact@senflowai.com.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
